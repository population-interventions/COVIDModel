Run a batch of simulations that test whether choice of scale has a consistent effect on the result.
Why is (yellowcount > redcount) a condition for scaledown?

Speedup:
 * Replace "any? other simuls-here with [ householdUnit != [ householdUnit ] of myself" in general with a "am I at my house" check?
 * simul_visitDestination is particularly slow.
 * SIMUL_AVOID_STUDENT and SIMUL_AVOID are a bit slow.
 * move-to one-of simuls with [...] in simul_avoid_student is responsible for 30% of the compute time.

Questions
 * Ask questions about how essential workers should behave.
 * Ask questions about schools.
 * The trace efficiency equation can go negative.
 * Should people be able to be reinfected? What is the assumption here?

Notes to report?
 * The elimination policy triggers for transitions between stages 1b and 2 tend to fluctuate. There can be fewer than 1 case per day for the last seven days, causing a drop to stage 1b, and five or more cases in the last 14 days, causing an instant reset to stage 2.

Meeting notes:
 * Simple question - How are recovered people handled? Currently a recovered person has a 5% chance per day to turn into a succeptible person. They gain no vaccine-type benefit, which is very weird. They are also currently skipped over for vaccination.
 * Simple question - Are the death rates in setup::setdeathrisk good?

Note that whether school is open seems to be the main driver of infections. Students are probably following each other around much too often.

casesinperiod7_real or reported?
75% mask efficacy is two way. - Added some made up numbers.
Fix set track_and_trace_efficiency (0.63219 - (0.07213 * ln(casesinperiod7_real)))
fix 1b and 2
Think about how to do overseas cases better than the scaled probabily method that exists for now.
